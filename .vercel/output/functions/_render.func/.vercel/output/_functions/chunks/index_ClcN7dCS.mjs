Use `getServerSideProps` sparingly and prefer SSG or client-side fetching whenever possible.\r\n\r\n### 6. **Prefetching Links and Resources**\r\n\r\n- Use `next/link` with the `prefetch` option to pre-load routes for a smoother navigation experience.\r\n\r\n### 7. **Caching and Compression**\r\n\r\n- Utilize caching strategies with proper HTTP headers (e.g., `Cache-Control`) to cache static assets, pages, and API responses.\r\n- Enable **gzip** or **Brotli** compression on the server to reduce the size of transferred files.\r\n\r\n### 8. **Optimize Fonts**\r\n\r\n- Use `next/font` for optimized Google Fonts loading with less layout shift and font preloading.\r\n\r\n### 9. **Improve Lighthouse Score**\r\n\r\n- Run a Lighthouse audit to analyze your appâ€™s performance, accessibility, SEO, and best practices, then optimize based on its suggestions.\r\n- Focus on reducing **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**, **First Input Delay (FID)**, and **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)** for a better Core Web Vitals score.\r\n\r\n### 10. **Lazy Load Components**\r\n\r\n- Use dynamic imports for components that are not immediately necessary, such as modal windows or carousels, to speed up the initial load time.\r\n\r\n### 11. **Optimize Third-Party Scripts**\r\n\r\n- Defer loading of third-party scripts like analytics, ads, or social media widgets. Only load them when necessary to prevent them from blocking the initial page rendering.\r\n\r\n### 12. **Consider Edge Functions**\r\n\r\n- Use **Next.js Edge Functions** to run server-side code closer to the user for faster page rendering and low-latency data fetching.\r\n\r\nThese approaches will help improve both performance and user experience for your Next.js application.
